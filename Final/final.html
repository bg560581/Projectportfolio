        <h2>My Personal Website</h2> 

	<p>This past semester I set a goal for myself. I wanted to learn Javascript by the end of the semester. I set this goal because I am big into video games, art, and graphics, and I thought it would be really cool to learn not only how they worked but to be able to create one myself. About half way through the semester, I was able to finalize what I wanted my website to look like and moved towards that goal. With some outside help I learned how to use jquery, a little Javascript, and my website came to life.  
        </p>	
        
        <p>The main reason I created my website was to put all the art websites, course websites, and various other websites that I use regularly in one place. The website has several parts. The first part is the main container. In the main container I put a slideshow of about six images from the various different art websites I use. The slideshow uses mostly CSS3 and some HTML.</p>
        
        <p>On the left side of the webpage there is a white bar with an opacity of 0.3. Whenever you scroll over it,  it drops to an opacity of 0.7. This is the navigation to get everywhere else on the site. Once clicked on, the sidebar opens up a side menu that pushes the entire main container to the right.</p> 
        
        <p>The navigation bar is broken down even further, into a list with four items on it. The first, “My Website Pages,” is colored yellow and gives the user access to several other web pages. When you click on the yellow bar, another menu slides across on top of the first menu. I am going to refer to these separate menus as “layers”. On the second layer, you are shown another list. Each link in the list will take you to a different page, each of which is based around a different art website that I have created images on. The next link on the first layer, under the yellow bar, will open another layer for different art and web design sites that I use. This goes on all the way down the list allowing you to link to every website that I use for art, web design, and different links for all my different courses.</p> 
        
        <p>In order to make this menu work (having the different layers pile on top of each other), I used CSS, Jquery, Javascript, and obviously HTML. The piling effect is the CSS. The responsive menu, as well as the 3-D layering, is the Jquery. I used code that was pre-written on sites like Codrops and CodePen. Throughout the entire semester I worked with getting what looked the best and what suited the website material the best. I also took examples from a numerous amount of teaching sites like <em>W3Schools</em>.</p>
        
        <p>I think I have succeeded with it and for the most part it allows me to do what I wanted it to do. But I feel like there is always something on the site that needs a little tweaking. As of right now, I think that it looks like a semi-professional website and I am very excited to keep working on it to the point where it would be considered “professional.”</p>
        
        <p class="thanks"><em>Thank you for all your time and help this semester. Thank you so much with all your help in making my website to what it is and helping me  out after class almost every day. I plan on continuing my work on the website over break to make it look like a real professional site. I look forward to learning new things next semester that will help me build on my website even further.</em></p>
